# Battleship Challenge

Battleship Challenge is a Python-terminal game running in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.
It represents a simplified version of the original game, as each battleship occupies one square on the board.
This version of the game has been built with the aim to be involved in a funny exercise to familiarize with Object Oriented Programming.
Users fight against the computer and, in order to win, need to find all of its battleships before it finds theirs.

## How to play

<br>

Battleship Challenge is based on the classic pen-and-paper game. More information about it can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).
In this version, players enter their name and two boards are randomly generated: one for each opponent.
Players can see where their ships are, marked by a 'â– ' sign, but obviously cannot see where the computer's ships are.
Guesses can resukt in a 'miss', which is indicated on the boards with an 'x', or in a 'hit', which is marked by a '#'.
The player and the computer then take it in turns to make guesses and try to sink each other's battleships.
The winner is the one who sinks all of the opponent's battleships first.

## Features

<br>

- Random boards generation

    - Ships are randomly placed on both the player and computer boards (players cannot see where the computer's battleships are):

- Game area with scores and feedback messages

    - Before a new game starts, this area provides players with a nice couple of pictures depicting the game rules. They just differ in their colours, in relation to player-side and computer-side respectively:
    ![Game Rules](/assets/media/images-area.png "Game Rules")
    - Once the game is running, pictures change to reflect player and computer choices, scores get updated based on game rules, moves left decrement accordingly and a feedback message appears to the bottom to clearly state who scored (i.e. who won):
    ![Game Area](/assets/media/game-area.png "Game Area")
    - After the 9 regular moves - if you got there - as it always depends on the total scores made during the game (whose winner must score 5 out of 9), in case of a draw (of course, regardless that the very last move ends up with a "Draw!", as in the case depicted below, or not), a tie-break phase starts. Just next to the counter saying that there are no moves left, a very clear feedback message warns about that:
    ![Tie-Break](/assets/media/tie-break.png "Tie-Break")
    - Tie-break phase goes on, possibly going through other draws, until one of the opponents scores and the game over condition is met. When this finally happens, one last message clearly stating who won the game is shown. The moves-buttons disappear and a restart button pops up (also this one with feedback on hover) to invite players to enter a new game:

## Testing

<br>

- The website was successfully tested on different browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari.
- The website is responsive and looks good on different devices. Its functioning was successfully tested on all standard screen sizes by using Chrome DevTools as well as [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
- I confirmed that any single piece of text is readable, easy to understand and fully accessible.
- I confirmed that the whole Javascript logic addressing the game rules and every possible outcome properly works.

## Bugs

<br>

- Fixed bugs

    - There were some logic issues in properly handling the tie-break phase. Everything was fixed and retest after reviewing a few lines of JS code. Relevant comments have also been added to the code for reference.

<br>

- Unfixed bugs

    - No bugs at this writing.

<br>

- Future developments

    - Since it is just a simple game, with no need to capture user choices, any impression of 'overengineering' has been averted. Yet, it could still make sense to move the comparison logic used within the checkWinner() function to a data structure, i.e. an array of dictionaries, with each element representing everything we need to know about a specific move against any others.
